AsciiDoc Version 8.3
====================

This is significant release, it gets rid of unused cruft, simplifies
the http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/newlists.html[lists] syntax and
introduces a decent
http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/newtables.html[tables] syntax.

New Features
------------
- AsciiDoc http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/newtables.html[new
  tables] are a complete redesign of the tables syntax and generation.
  It's a huge improvement over the old tables.

- AsciiDoc http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/newlists.html[new lists]
  are a unification and simplification of the existing list syntax and
  and internal rewrite.

Backward Incompatibilities
--------------------------
The 8.3 release is not fully backward compatible as detailed below.
If the changes impact you and you are unable or unwilling to upgrade
your AsciiDoc files then you should continue to use version
8.2.7.

- The AsciiDoc version 6 'xhtml-deprecated' backend has been dropped.

- The 'linuxdoc' backend has been dropped (this backend is not longer
  used and was marked for removal when AsciiDoc version 7 was
  released).

- The http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/#X1[experimental LaTeX
  backend] is currently unsupported.

- The http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/newlists.html[new lists] have
  introduced a number of incompatibilities.
