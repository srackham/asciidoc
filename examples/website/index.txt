.{revdate}: AsciiDoc {revnumber} Released
************************************************************************
Lots of fairly small stuff in this release, but with over thirty items
in the CHANGELOG it adds up to a fairly substantial release. Here are
some points of interest:

. Multiple manpage names are now handled correctly when generating
  DocBook output -- each name now generates a separate DocBook
  `<refname>` element. See
  http://groups.google.com/group/asciidoc/browse_thread/thread/c93bb4db025225d8[the
  discussion list] for details.
. The article and book document header can now include a revision
  remark.
. French, German, Hungarian and Russian language file contributions.

Read the link:CHANGELOG.html[CHANGELOG] for a full list of all
additions and changes. Changes are documented in the updated
link:userguide.html[User Guide].

NOTE: The distribution tarballs are no longer on this
website, get them from the
http://sourceforge.net/projects/asciidoc/[SourceForge].

Introduction
------------
AsciiDoc is a text document format for writing short documents,
articles, books and UNIX man pages. AsciiDoc files can be translated
to HTML and DocBook markups using the asciidoc(1) command.

AsciiDoc is highly configurable: both the AsciiDoc source file syntax
and the backend output markups (which can be almost any type of
SGML/XML markup) can be customized and extended by the user.

TIP: The pages you are reading were written using AsciiDoc, to view
the corresponding AsciiDoc source click on the *Page Source* menu item
in the left hand margin.


Overview and Examples
---------------------
You write an AsciiDoc document the same way you would write a
normal text document, there are no markup tags or weird format
notations. AsciiDoc files are designed to be viewed, edited and
printed directly or translated to other presentation formats using
the asciidoc(1) command.

The asciidoc(1) command translates AsciiDoc files to HTML, XHTML and
DocBook markups.  DocBook can be post-processed to presentation
formats such as HTML, PDF, DVI, LaTeX, roff, and Postscript using
readily available Open Source tools.

Example Articles
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- This version of the
  link:asciidoc.css-embedded.html[AsciiDoc User Guide]
  was generated by AsciiDoc from
  link:asciidoc.txt[this AsciiDoc file].

- Here's the link:asciidoc.html[same document] created by first
  generating DocBook markup using AsciiDoc and then converting the
  DocBook markup to HTML using 'DocBook XSL Stylesheets'.

- The User Guide again, this time a
  link:chunked/index.html[chunked version].

- This link:article.txt[AsciiDoc article template] produced
  this link:article.html[HTML file] and this
  link:article.pdf[PDF file] via DocBook markup generated by AsciiDoc.

- This link:asciidoc.pdf[PDF formatted User Guide] was generated from
  asciidoc(1) DocBook output.

Example Books
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
AsciiDoc markup supports all the standard DocBook frontmatter and
backmatter sections (dedication, preface, bibliography, glossary,
index, colophon) plus footnotes and index entries.

Book::
    This link:book.txt[AsciiDoc book's] DocBook output
    produced link:book.html[this HTML file] using the
    'DocBook XSL Stylesheets'.

Multi-part book::
    This link:book-multi.txt[multi-part AsciiDoc book's]
    DocBook output produced link:book-multi.html[this HTML file]
    using the 'DocBook XSL Stylesheets'.

Example UNIX Man Pages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
HTML formatted AsciiDoc man pages
link:asciidoc.1.css-embedded.html[with stylesheets] and
link:asciidoc.1.html[without stylesheets] were generated by AsciiDoc
from link:asciidoc.1.txt[this file].

This link:asciidoc.1[roff formatted  man page] was generated from
asciidoc(1) DocBook output using `xsltproc(1)` and DocBook XSL
Stylesheets.

Example Web Site
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The link:README-website.html[AsciiDoc website] is included in the
AsciiDoc distribution (in `./examples/website/`) as example website
built using AsciiDoc.  See `./examples/website/README-website.txt`.

More examples
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Henrik Maier produced this professional User manual using AsciiDoc:
  http://www.proconx.com/gcpmg/UMGCPMG-0801.pdf.
- Henrik also produced this folded single page brochure format
  example: http://www.proconx.com/gcpmg/IGGCPMG-0801-up.pdf.

Music Filter
------------
A link:music-filter.html[music filter] is included in the distribution
`./filters/` directory. It translates music in
http://lilypond.org/[LilyPond] or http://abcnotation.org.uk/[ABC]
notation to standard classical notation


Source Code Highlight Filter
----------------------------
A link:source-highlight-filter.html[source code highlight filter] is
included in the distribution `./filters/` directory.


[[X4]]
Graphviz Filter
---------------
Gouichi Iisaka has written a http://www.graphviz.org/[Graphviz] filter
for AsciiDoc.  Graphviz generates diagrams from a textual
specification. Gouichi Iisaka's Graphviz filter is included in the
AsciiDoc distribution. Here are some
link:asciidoc-graphviz-sample.html[AsciiDoc Graphviz examples].


[[X3]]
Mathematical Formulae
---------------------
You can include mathematical formulae in AsciiDoc XHTML documents using
link:asciimathml.html[ASCIIMathML] or link:latexmathml.html[LaTeXMathML]
notation.

link:latexmath.pdf[LaTeX Math] can be included in AsciiDoc
documents processed by `dblatex(1)`.


Vim Syntax Highlighter
----------------------
An AsciiDoc syntax highlighter for the Vim text editor is included in
the AsciiDoc distribution (see 'Appendix F' of the 'AsciiDoc User
Guide' for details).

Dag Wieers has implemented an alternative Vim syntax file for AsciiDoc
which can be found here

  AsciiDoc for it's http://www.wesnoth.org/wiki/WesnothManual[Manual]
  in a number of different languages.

LaTeX Backend
-------------
An experimental LaTeX backend was written for AsciiDoc in 2006 by
Benjamin Klum.  Benjamin did a superhuman job (I admit it, I didn't
think this was doable due to AsciiDoc's SGML/XML bias).  Owning to to
other commitments, Benjamin was unable to maintain this backend.
Here's link:latex-backend.html[Benjamin's original documentation].
Incompatibilities introduced after AsciiDoc 8.2.7 broke the LaTeX
backend.

In 2009 Geoff Eddy stepped up and updated the LaTeX backend, thanks to
Geoff's efforts it now works with AsciiDoc 8.4.3. Geoff's updated
`latex.conf` file shipped with AsciiDoc version 8.4.4. The backend
still has limitations and remains experimental (see
link:latex-bugs.html[Geoff's notes]).

It's probably also worth pointing out that LaTeX output can be
generated by passing AsciiDoc generated DocBook through `dblatex(1)`.
