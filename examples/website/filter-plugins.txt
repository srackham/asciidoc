AsciiDoc Filter Plugins
=======================

Filter plugins are a simple mechanism for distributing AsciiDoc
filters.  A filter plugin is a Zip file containing the files that
constitute a filter. The asciidoc(1) link:manpage.html[--filter
option] implements commands to install, remove and list filter
plugins.

IMPORTANT: Until AsciiDoc 8.6.4 is released you will need to run from
the
link:INSTALL.html#_installing_from_the_mercurial_repository[AsciiDoc
trunk] to use the new asciidoc(1) filter plugin commands,
alternatively you could manually unzip to the appropriately named
filters subdirectory.
