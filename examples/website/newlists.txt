AsciiDoc New Lists
==================

The 'new lists' changes were added to the trunk in September 2008 and
will appear in a future release. Adventurous sorts can grab the trunk
from http://hg.sharesource.org/asciidoc/.

'newlists' have been implemented to:

. Simplify the list syntax:

  * 'glossary', 'qanda' (Question and Answer) and 'bibliography' lists
    use the existing 'bulleted' and 'numbered' syntaxes with
    'glossary', 'qanda' and 'bibliography' styles. The old list
    syntaxes are still processed but a deprecation warning is issued.

  * The two 'labeled list' syntaxes ('vertical' and 'horizontal') have
    been combined into a single 'labeled list' syntax. The
    'horizontal' style is used to render a horizontal labeled list.

. Rewrite the list internals to implement 'styles' and to refactor
  list tags into separate `[listtags-<name>]` conf file sections.

These changes necessitated the following backward incompatibilities:

. You have to explicitly precede horizontal labeled lists with the
  `[horizontal]` style attribute -- if you do nothing the existing
  horizontal labeled lists will be rendered vertically.
. The old 'compact' list style is now implemented as a list option, to
  update replace `[compact]` with `[options="compact"]`.
. You'll need to update any customized the configuration files list
  definitions that have been made.
