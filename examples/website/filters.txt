AsciiDoc Filters
================


AsciiDoc link:userguide#X59[filters] allow external commands to
process AsciiDoc 'Paragraphs', 'DelimitedBlocks' and 'Table' content.
Filters are primarily an extension mechanism for generating
specialized outputs. Filters are available as external
<<_filter_plugins,plugins>> and come
<<_built_in_filters,pre-installed>>.


Filter Plugins
--------------
Filter plugins are a simple mechanism (introduced in AsciiDoc 8.6.4)
for distributing AsciiDoc filters.  A filter plugin is a Zip file
containing the files that constitute a filter. The asciidoc(1)
link:manpage.html[--filter option] implements commands to install,
remove and list filter plugins.

Here is a list of publically available filter plugins (if you have
implemented a plugin and it's not in the list please post a message to
the http://groups.google.com/group/asciidoc[asciidoc discussion list]
and I'll include it in the list).
