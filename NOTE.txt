This the AsciiDoc the legacy hg repository archive at [Google
Code](https://code.google.com/archive/p/asciidoc/) exported to Git.

In 2013, after over 10 years of AsciiDoc development, I retired from
the project in order to spend more time on other things.

This repo is frozen at my final commit on 27-Nov-2013 with the
addition of the NOTE.txt file.
